<hr />
<p>My name is Sugimoto Shoujin, a sophomore Business Administration and Computer Science student in the National University of Singapore. </p>

<p>My career interests lie in Machine Learning, Venture Capital and Entrepreneurship and my professional experience is centred around Business Analytics and Product Management.</p>

<p>During my free time, I enjoy boxing, playing the guitar and talking to new people. I am an avid solo backpacker and some countries that I have been to are Philippines (amazing marine life), Vietnam (my favourite country!), Thailand (best food in the world!).</p>
